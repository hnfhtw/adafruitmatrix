Adafruit RGB LED Panel Framebuffer

CHANGELOG:
V01: Support only for 1, 2 or 4 panel columns (panels switched in series), but multiple panel rows
V02: Support for 3 or 5 panel columns enabled:
	 ctrl.vhd: 		Addressing of framebuffer changed from RRRR PP XXXXX to PP RRRR XXXXX
					(with RRRR = 4 address bits A-D, PP = panel number, XXXXX = 5 Bits for pixel number)
					Panel counter had to be changed, overflow counter could count only to 2^n
	 matrix.vhd: 	MIF files had to be changed due to new framebuffer address format.
					
					Old format of addresses(example for 128x16 -> upper half of a 128x32 image):
					0 ....... 31 32 ....... 63 64 ....... 95 96 ....... 127
					128 .... 159 160 ..... 191 192 ..... 223 224 ...... 255
					.                                                     .
					.  Panel 1      Panel 2        Panel 3      Panel 4   .
					.                                                     .
					1920 .. 1951 1952 ... 1983 1984 ... 2015 2016 .... 2047
					
					New format of addresses(example for 128x16 -> upper half of a 128x32 image):
					0 ....... 31 512 ..... 543 1024 ... 1055 1536 .... 1567
					32 ...... 63 544 ..... 575 1056 ... 1087 1568 .... 1599	
					.                                                     .
					.  Panel 1      Panel 2        Panel 3      Panel 4   .
					.                                                     .
					480 ..... 511 992 ... 1023 1504 ... 1535 2016 .... 2047

V03: Reservation of unused RAM avoided:
	 testram.vhd:    Generic ADDR_WIDTH exchanged with DATA_RANGE -> memory_t array changed from 2^ADDR_WIDTH
	                 to the actual needed value given by DATA_RANGE
	 matrix.vhd:     Adaptions for the ADDR_WIDHT -> DATA_RANGE changed
	                 First signal definitions for RGB data decoder which fills the framebuffers

V04: RGB data decoder implemented which sets the s_we signal for the correct framebuffer.
	 matrix.vhd:     Decoder code implemented
	 Example for 4x4 Panels: Input address format s_waddr_i = PP TTT RRRR XXXXX -> PP = panel column number, TTT = panel row number, RRRR = pixel row number, XXXXX = pixel column number
	                         Output address format s_waddr = PP RRRR XXXXX and s_we(TTT) -> set write address at all framebuffers but activate only the correct one for writing
	 -> the 24 Bit wide data input s_data_i, the write clock s_wclk_i and the relevant parts of s_waddr_i are directly connected to all framebuffers
	 -> writing this data to the correct framebuffer is ensued by the decoder which evaluates the TTT part of the input address s_waddr_i
	 Testbench updated to test the decoder in modelsim (matrix_tb.vhd, compile.do and sim.do updated)
	
TODO:
Tidy up rtl/ctrl.vhd
    -> 1 counter module, 4 instantiations
	-> check counter, currently BCM Bit 0 is written to the wrong (previous) RGB pixel row address (A-D)
Check 1 Pixel shift (currently the pixels are shifted by 1 too far -> clock  topic or code issue?)
Implement some "image download mechanism"
