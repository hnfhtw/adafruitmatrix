Adafruit RGB LED Panel Framebuffer

NOTE:
Files in testbench (tb) and simulation (sim) folders not up to date.
Currently support only for 1, 2 or 4 panel columns (panels switched in series), but multiple panel rows

TODO:
Tidy up rtl/ctrl.vhd
    -> 1 counter module, 4 instantiations
	-> check counter, currently BCM Bit 0 is written to the wrong (previous) RGB pixel row address (A-D)
Check support of number of panel columns other than 1, 2 or 4
Add output regs to RAM blocks to improve timing
Implement some "image download mechanism"
